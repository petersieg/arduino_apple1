## Apple 1 emu for Raspberry PI 2040 MCU

Code required NO changes for rpi2040, compared to standard arduino ino.

Just copy uf2 file to rpi2040 usb stick for flash it.

If you switch on verbose logging at compile time, you can see where uf2 file is created in temp folder. Just save this uf2 file to somewhere else to be used later.
